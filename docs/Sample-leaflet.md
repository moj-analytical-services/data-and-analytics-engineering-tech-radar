# Data and Analytics Engineering Tech Radar Refresh

**Event Day:** 
**Event Time:** 
**Event Location:**

## Overview

The MoJ Data and Analytics Engineering community maintains a public Tech Radar to help align technology choices within and across our teams. This Tech Radar is based on the pioneering work by ThoughtWorks.

The Tech Radar serves as a point-in-time snapshot of tools, techniques, platforms, languages, and frameworks relevant to our teams. Each technology or technique is represented by a `blip` and assigned a rating, which can change over time. Blips can appear or disappear, with a maximum of ~125 blips to make the Tech Radar navigable. We aim to refresh the Tech Radar on a yearly basis.

We use GitHub discussions to provide feedback on the blips, which is then extracted using the GitHub GraphQL API and published to GitHub Pages using a GitHub workflow. We also use Zalando's radar.js JavaScript library to visualize the Tech Radar.

  - Identification of action items and next steps for implementation.  
  - Closing remarks and appreciation for participation.

## Team Discussion

We have divided the Data and Analytics Engineering community into five groups. Each group has an assigned facilitator and a category of blips to review. This approach helps focus feedback during the event, and, progressively, members of other group will have the opportunity to provide feedback on other blips.

1. Open the Tech Radar discussions link.
2. Filter on assigned category or the relevant analytics engineering label.
3. The group facilitator will select the initial blip for discussion.
4. The group facilitator will create a new comment with the heading `## 2024 August` if it is not already there.
5. The group facilitator will add a link to the technology if not already present.
6. Add an emoji to represent the assignment â€“ have a look at the labels for a short explanation of the assignment or the Tech Radar for a longer explanation.
7. Add any relevant comments or insights.
8. The group facilitator will assign an assessment/close the discussion based on the emojis.
9. Discuss any disagreements before proceeding to the next blip.
10. There will be 10 mins at the end of the 1-hour session to introduce new blips.
11. You can provide feedback on other blips during the presentation or afterwards on GitHub Discussions.

## What Are We Gaining from This Event?

We aim to gather diverse perspectives and expertise on current and emerging technologies from our engineers, and reflect the collective input in our GitHub Discussions for an accurate Tech Radar refresh.

## What Will We Do After the Event?

We will seek input from engineers who were not available on the event day. Based on all the input received during and after the event, we aim to update our Tech Radar on a later date.

## How Can I Learn More About Tech Radar?

You can learn more about Tech Radar by visiting the Tech Radar GitHub repo, where you can find instructions on how to use Tech Radar locally. If you want to manage discussions, here is the discussion link.

## What Is My Role as a Group Facilitator on the Event Day?
As a group facilitator, your responsibilities on the event day include:
- Familiarize yourself with the discussion process.
- Ensure everyone in your group focuses on the same blip at a time.
- Encourage participation and manage time effectively.
- Make sure each team member adds their emoji assessment for each blip.
- Verify that every blip has a technology link and necessary information.
- Introduce recommended technologies, ensuring the total number of blips for your category does not exceed 25.
- Provide a concise summary of your team's discussions and outcomes at the end of the session.
- Present any open questions or challenges that emerged during the discussion.
- Update the markdown-based slides, summarizing the most controversial new and paused blips. Follow these instructions to update the slides.
- Seek feedback from engineers who were not available on the event day.
- Ensure all blips in your category are assigned or closed prior to the agreed final refresh date.
