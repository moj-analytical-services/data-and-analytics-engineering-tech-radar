# Data and Analytics Engineering Tech Radar Refresh

**Event Day:** 

**Event Location:**

The MoJ Data and Analytics Engineering community maintains a public Tech Radar to help align technology choices within and across our teams. This Tech Radar is based on the pioneering work by ThoughtWorks.

The Tech Radar is a point-in-time snapshot of tools, techniques, platforms, languages, and frameworks relevant to our teams. Each technology or technique is represented by a `blip` and assigned a rating, which can change over time. Blips can appear or disappear, with a maximum of ~125 blips to make the Tech Radar navigable. We aim to refresh the Tech Radar on a yearly basis.

We use GitHub discussions to provide feedback on the blips, which is then extracted using the GitHub GraphQL API and published to GitHub Pages using a GitHub workflow. We also use Zalando's radar.js JavaScript library to visualize the Tech Radar.

## Team Discussion

We have split the Data and Analytics Engineering community into 5 groups. Each group has been assigned a group facilitator and a category of blips to review to make it easier to obtain feedback on the day. However, you will have the opportunity to provide feedback on all blips.

1. Open the Tech Radar discussions link.
2. Filter on your category (or analytics engineering label).
3. The group facilitator will select the first blip.
4. The group facilitator will create a new comment with the heading `## 2024 August` if it is not already there.
5. The group facilitator will add a link to the technology if not already present.
6. Add an emoji to represent the assignment â€“ have a look at the labels for a short explanation of the assignment or the Tech Radar for a longer explanation.
7. Add comments if needed.
8. The group facilitator will assign an assessment/close the discussion based on the emojis.
9. Discuss if there's a disagreement; otherwise, proceed to the next blip.
10. There will be 10 mins at the end of the 1-hour session to introduce new blips.
11. You can provide feedback on the other blips during the presentation or after the session on the GitHub discussion.

## What Are We Gaining from This Event?

We hope that most of the data and analytics engineers will join this event. We aim to gather maximum insights from our engineers and update our GitHub discussion accordingly.

## What Will We Do After the Event?

We will seek input from engineers who were not available on the event day. Based on all the input received during and after the event, we aim to update our Tech Radar by Friday, 16th August.

## How Can I Learn More About Tech Radar?

You can learn more about Tech Radar by visiting the Tech Radar GitHub repo, where you can find instructions on how to use Tech Radar locally. If you want to manage discussions, here is the discussion link.

## What Is My Role as a Group Facilitator on the Event Day?

- Understand how to engage in the discussion.
- Ensure everyone in your group focuses on the same blip at a time.
- Make sure everyone adds their emoji.
- Ensure a technology link is added to every blip.
- Add recommended technologies, but ensure the total does not exceed 25.
- Provide a summary of your team's achievements at the end of the session.
- Present any open questions or challenges that arose during the discussion.
- Update the markdown-based slides, summarizing the most controversial new and paused blips. Follow these instructions to update the slides.
- Get feedback from people who did not participate on the day.
- Ensure all blips in your category have an assignment or are closed by 15th August.
