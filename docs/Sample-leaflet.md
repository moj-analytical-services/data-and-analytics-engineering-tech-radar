## Tech Radar Overview

The MoJ Data and Analytics Engineering community maintains a public Tech Radar to help align technology choices within and across our teams. Inspired by the pioneering work of [ThoughtWorks](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar), our [Tech Radar](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar) provides a snapshot of tools, techniques, platforms, languages, and frameworks relevant to our teams at a specific point in time. 

Each technology or technique is represented by a `blip` and assigned a rating, which can change over time. Blips can appear or disappear, and we limit the total number to approximately 125 to keep the Tech Radar navigable. Our goal is to refresh the Tech Radar annually.

We use **GitHub discussions** to provide feedback on the blips. This feedback is extracted using the GitHub GraphQL API and published to GitHub Pages using a GitHub workflow. We also use Zalando's radar.js JavaScript library to visualize the Tech Radar.

  - Each team presents a summary of their discussions.  
  - Highlight key takeaways, new entries, and any open questions or areas requiring further investigation.  
  - Open forum for cross-team discussion and knowledge sharing.  

- **16:00 - 16:05** - Final Thoughts & Action Planning (5 mins)  
  - Recap of key takeaways and emerging trends.  
  - Identification of action items and next steps for implementation.  
  - Closing remarks and appreciation for participation.

## Team Discussion

We have divided the Data and Analytics Engineering community into five groups. Each group has an assigned facilitator and a category of blips to review. This focused approach helps streamline feedback during the event. Over time, members will have the opportunity to provide feedback on other blips.

1. Open the Tech Radar discussions link.
2. Filter on assigned category or the relevant analytics engineering label.
3. The group facilitator will select the initial blip for discussion.
4. If it isn't already there, the facilitator will create a new comment with the heading `## [Month Year]` *(e.g., `## August 2024`)*.
5. Ensure each blip includes a link to the technology if not already present.
6. Add an emoji to represent the assignment â€“ Refer to the labels for a brief explanation of the assignment or consult the Tech Radar for a detailed explanation.
7. Add any relevant comments or insights.
8. The group facilitator will assign an assessment/close the discussion based on the emojis.
9. Discuss any disagreements before proceeding to the next blip.
10. There will be 10 mins at the end of the 1-hour session to introduce new blips.
11. You can provide feedback on other blips during the presentation or afterwards on GitHub Discussions.

## What Are We Gaining from This Event?

By bringing together the collective expertise of our engineers, we aim to:

- Ensure our teams are on the same page regarding tools and technologies.
- Keep up with emerging trends and assess their potential impact.
- Encourage knowledge sharing across teams.
- Reflect our collective input in GitHub Discussions for an accurate Tech Radar refresh.

## What Will We Do After the Event?

We will seek input from engineers who were not available on the event day. Based on all the input received during and after the event, we aim to update our Tech Radar on a later date.

## How Can I Learn More About Tech Radar?

You can learn more about Tech Radar by visiting the Tech Radar GitHub repo, where you can find instructions on how to use Tech Radar locally. If you want to manage discussions, here is the discussion link.

## What Is My Role as a Group Facilitator on the Event Day?
As a group facilitator, your responsibilities on the event day include:
- Familiarize yourself with the discussion process.
- Ensure everyone in your group focuses on the same blip at a time.
- Encourage participation and manage time effectively.
- Make sure each team member adds their emoji assessment for each blip.
- Verify that every blip has a technology link and necessary information.
- Introduce recommended technologies, ensuring the total number of blips for your category does not exceed 25.
- Provide a concise summary of your team's discussions and outcomes at the end of the session.
- Present any open questions or challenges that emerged during the discussion.
- Update the markdown-based slides, summarizing the most controversial new and paused blips. Follow these instructions to update the slides.
- Seek feedback from engineers who were not available on the event day.
- Ensure all blips in your category are assigned or closed prior to the agreed final refresh date.
