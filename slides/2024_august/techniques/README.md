# [Techniques](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar/2024_august/techniques)

## Data and Analytics Engineering

##### August 2024

---

## New Techniques

- Most techniques on the radar are relatively mature at this point. Radar hasn't changed much.
- Notifications
  - More standardised practices and documentation for this    
- Github as a one-stop shop (favour where appropriate)

---

## Techniques on pause

- Repository template
  - Hard to find maintainers and keep templates up-to-date
- DevOps
  - Understanding vs practioner. Most of the main techniques are captured in other blips
- Monorepos vs Multirepos
  - Very dependent on the situation you find yourself in
  - Debate should be down to the team
- Git histories (could potentially be in assess)
- my code works! (I've no idea why)/Chaos

---

##  Techniques to assess

- User Testing
  - More tools to get stakeholders to get more actively involved
  - Where does this process end and interactions with analytics engineers
