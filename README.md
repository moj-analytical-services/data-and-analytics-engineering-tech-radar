# Data and Analytics Engineering Tech Radar

Uses [generate-tech-radar](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/generate-tech-radar) to visualise tech radar blips configured in `blips.json` against tech radar rings and quadrants configured in `radar_config.json`.

Saves and extracts tech radar blips to and from GitHub discussions.

Adapted from [Zalando's](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/) and [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar) technology radars.
