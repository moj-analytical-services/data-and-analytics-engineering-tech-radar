# Data and Analytics Engineering Tech Radar

The MoJ [Data and Analytics Engineering community](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering/)
maintains a [public Tech Radar](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering-tech-radar/) to help
align technology choices within our teams. This Tech Radar is based on [pioneering work
by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) and uses Zalando's JavaScript Library
[`radar.js`](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar/blob/master/docs/radar.js) with [d3.js v4](https://d3js.org) for visualisation.

Tech radar blips are configured in `blips.json`, while tech radar rings and quadrants are set up in `radar_config.json`. Additional context for the blips is provided by GitHub discussions, which are queried using the GitHub GraphQL API to populate `blips.json`
